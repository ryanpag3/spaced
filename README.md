# Spaced

Spaced is an open and transparent social media platform built upon the following three principles:

- Privacy: Your data is your data. You can control it as you please.
- Integrity: A social media platform has a moral responsibility to respect its users.
- Honesty: Transparency is the only catalyst for trust for social media.

This project is in active development, with a more formal roadmap coming soon.
