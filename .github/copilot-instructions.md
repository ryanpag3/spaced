## Typescript

- All models will be classes with singular naming (i.e. `User` for the `users` table)
- Indent with 2 spaces only
- Variables will be camelCase
- Constants will be in all caps with underscores
- All functions will be in camelCase
- The code should be as self-documenting as possible. Only use comments when absolutely necessary.
- Always run "organize imports" after editing each file
