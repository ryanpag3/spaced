## Typescript

- All models will be classes with singular naming (i.e. `User` for the `users` table)
- Indent with 2 spaces only
- Variables will be camelCase
- Constants will be in all caps with underscores
- All functions will be in camelCase
- The code should be as self-documenting as possible.
- Only use comments when absolutely necessary. Avoid in-line code comments as much as possible.
- Do not define comments that just explain what the code does. Comments should only add context that is not obvious.
- Use yarn instead of npm when possible
- Encapsulate common functionality into functions or components as much as possible
- Only recreate files from scratch if absolutely necessary. Prefer to refactor in place.
- If a function is longer than 5-10 lines, break it down into smaller functions.
- Always write tests for the code.
